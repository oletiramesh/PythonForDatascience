MODULE 1.2 
Python KEYWORDS:
Keywords are the reserved words in python
We can't use a keyword as variable name, function name or any other identifier
Keywords are case sensitive
PYTHON IDENTIFIERS:
Identifier is the name given to entities like class, functions, variables etc. in Python. It helps differentiating one entity from another.
??) Rules for Writing Identifiers:
***Identifiers can be a combination of letters in lowercase (a to z) or uppercase (A to Z) or digits (0 to 9) or an underscore (_).
***An identifier cannot start with a digit. 1variable is invalid, but variable1 is perfectly fine.
***Keywords cannot be used as identifiers
